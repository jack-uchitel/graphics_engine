# graphics_engine
This is some of the code from CS311: Computer Graphics. In it, we designed graphics engines using both triangle rasterization and ray tracing. The code was a collaboration between me and my class partner Jade Kandel, with unfinished starter code provided by our teacher, Josh Davis.
